# Generate Command Line Options

By default, the Typesetter generate command will work without any options. However, there are some that you want to use.

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `--config` | This is the path and filename relative to your current working directory of the config file. Default is `config.php` in the local directory. |
| `--output` | This is the path and filename relative to your current working directory of the output file. Directories will be created. Default is the current directory with a slugified version of the title. |

Excellent! Now, maybe you want to move on to [customizing the configuration](config) of your project.
